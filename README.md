# socket

Gale's Codex plugin marketplace for macOS users and Apple/Swift devs. Includes companion plugins for my other packages, like SwiftASB.

`Socket` is the "marketplace", or catalog, of available plugins. Add `socket` to Codex, then use Codex to choose which individual plugins you wanna install.

## Overview

### Status

`socket` is active, maintained, and used by Gale daily.

### What This Project Is

Socket is a monorepo of Codex Plugins I've built while beginning to use coding agents to assist in my projects. It includes a variety of plugins, from productivity tools to apple dev workflow systems, docs access to a local TTS system. 

### Motivation

It became obvious to me that these things needed specialized tooling to do specialized work. Not seeing much of what I wanted on offer, I set out to build that myself. Eventually, I moved all my individual plugin repos to this monorepo for easier maintenance, updates, releases, etc.

## Quick Start

Add the `socket` marketplace to Codex with:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add gaelic-ghost/socket
```

When the marketplace changes, refresh it with:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade socket
```

After adding or upgrading `socket`, restart your Codex, open the plugin directory, select `Socket`, and then install or enable whichever plugins you want.

## Usage

Use `socket` when you want one Codex catalog for Gale's agent-focused plugin set.

Currently available from the catalog:

- `agent-plugin-skills`
- `apple-dev-skills`
- `cardhop-app`
- `productivity-skills`
- `python-skills`
- `speak-swiftly`
- `swiftasb-skills`
- `things-app`

## Plugin Status

Apple Dev Skills keeps its own roadmap because it is the remaining subtree-managed child with a deeper standalone release surface. Other child planning now lives in [TODO.md](./TODO.md).

Current Socket catalog shape:

- `agent-plugin-skills`: active maintainer skills for skills-export and plugin-export repositories
- `apple-dev-skills`: active Apple, Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, and DocC workflows with its own roadmap
- `cardhop-app`: active mixed skill plus bundled MCP server for Cardhop.app contact workflows
- `productivity-skills`: active general-purpose maintainer and documentation workflow baseline
- `python-skills`: active Python, `uv`, FastAPI, FastMCP, and pytest workflow plugin
- `speak-swiftly`: active Git-backed Speak Swiftly plugin from the standalone SpeakSwiftlyServer repository
- `swiftasb-skills`: active SwiftASB companion guidance
- `things-app`: active mixed skill plus bundled MCP server for Things.app workflows

Placeholder plugin directories are intentionally visible but not installable until real skill or workflow content exists:

- `dotnet-skills`
- `rust-skills`
- `spotify`
- `web-dev-skills`

## Development

For setup, local workflow, validation, review, release, and maintainer expectations, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). For the consolidated child backlog, see [TODO.md](./TODO.md). For agent-facing repo rules, see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).
