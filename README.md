# SpeakSwiftlyServer

Swift executable package for a shared localhost host process that exposes the public `SpeakSwiftly` runtime surface through an app-friendly HTTP API and an optional MCP surface.

## Overview

This repository is the standalone Swift service for `SpeakSwiftly`. It uses [Hummingbird](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird) to host one localhost macOS process with in-memory job tracking and server-sent events, while delegating speech, voice-profile management, and worker lifecycle to the typed `SpeakSwiftly` runtime. That shared process can mount both the HTTP API and the MCP surface without creating duplicate `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime` owners.

### Deployment Targets

Current intended deployment targets are:

- macOS 15 and newer for the standalone server package and initial app-managed installation path
- iOS 18 and newer for a near-future app-facing reuse path once the host logic is split cleanly enough to be consumed from an iOS app

The current executable package is still macOS-only, but its host and state architecture should be kept friendly to an eventual iOS extraction into a reusable library target.

Linux support is a medium-term consideration rather than a current promise. If making this Swift package Linux-compatible starts forcing awkward compromises into the Apple-first host and app architecture, a separate Linux implementation in Rust is an acceptable direction instead of contorting this package.

### Motivation

The target is a thin Swift service that a forthcoming macOS app can install and manage as a LaunchAgent without needing a separate Python runtime. Early development aimed to stay close to the existing Python server contract, but the current service now follows the newer `SpeakSwiftly` control model directly where the runtime surface has evolved.

That means this package intentionally stays narrow: Hummingbird for transport hosting, `SpeakSwiftly` for speech and profile operations, and a small amount of server state to translate typed runtime events into retained job snapshots, SSE replay, and MCP resources.

### Current SpeakSwiftly Alignment

The sibling [`SpeakSwiftly`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftly) checkout currently resolves to tag `v0.9.1`, and this server is aligned to that public library surface rather than an older private worker boundary.

Today the server talks directly to:

- `SpeakSwiftly.live()`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.statusEvents()`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.speak(text:with:as:id:)`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.createProfile(named:from:voice:outputPath:id:)`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.profiles(id:)`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.removeProfile(named:id:)`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.queue(_:id:)`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.playback(_:id:)`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.clearQueue(id:)`
- `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.cancelRequest(_:requestID:)`

The server also consumes the public summary and event types that those calls vend, including `SpeakSwiftly.RequestHandle`, `SpeakSwiftly.RequestEvent`, `SpeakSwiftly.StatusEvent`, `SpeakSwiftly.ProfileSummary`, `SpeakSwiftly.ActiveRequest`, `SpeakSwiftly.QueuedRequest`, and `SpeakSwiftly.PlaybackStateSnapshot`.

That alignment means the remaining translation layer is intentionally transport-local: snake_case HTTP and MCP payload shaping, retained job snapshots, and SSE framing. The server is not reaching through the library boundary to construct raw worker protocol messages or private runtime state directly.

That narrowness also informs platform policy. The package should prefer maintainable Apple-platform architecture for the current macOS and near-future iOS use cases over speculative cross-platform compromises.

## Setup

Build the package with SwiftPM:

```bash
swift build
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
swift test
```

## Usage

Run the server locally:

```bash
swift run SpeakSwiftlyServer
```

The shared server binds to `127.0.0.1:7337` by default and supports these environment variables:

- `APP_CONFIG_FILE`
- `APP_NAME`
- `APP_ENVIRONMENT`
- `APP_HOST`
- `APP_PORT`
- `APP_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`
- `APP_COMPLETED_JOB_TTL_SECONDS`
- `APP_COMPLETED_JOB_MAX_COUNT`
- `APP_JOB_PRUNE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
- `APP_HTTP_ENABLED`
- `APP_HTTP_HOST`
- `APP_HTTP_PORT`
- `APP_HTTP_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`
- `APP_MCP_ENABLED`
- `APP_MCP_PATH`
- `APP_MCP_SERVER_NAME`
- `APP_MCP_TITLE`

If `APP_CONFIG_FILE` points at a YAML file, the server loads it through [apple/swift-configuration](https://github.com/apple/swift-configuration) with environment variables taking precedence over YAML and YAML taking precedence over built-in defaults. The expected YAML shape mirrors the nested config reader keys:

```yaml
app:
  name: speak-swiftly-server
  environment: development
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 7337
  sseHeartbeatSeconds: 10
  completedJobTTLSeconds: 900
  completedJobMaxCount: 200
  jobPruneIntervalSeconds: 60
  http:
    enabled: true
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 7337
    sseHeartbeatSeconds: 10
  mcp:
    enabled: false
    path: /mcp
    serverName: speak-to-user-mcp
    title: SpeakSwiftlyMCP
```

Top-level transport settings and HTTP-specific overrides intentionally compose this way:

- `APP_HOST`, `APP_PORT`, and `APP_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` define the shared transport defaults.
- `APP_HTTP_HOST`, `APP_HTTP_PORT`, and `APP_HTTP_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` override those defaults only for the HTTP surface.
- If you do not set an `APP_HTTP_*` value, the HTTP listener inherits the corresponding top-level `APP_*` value.

When `APP_CONFIG_FILE` is set, the server now watches that YAML file for changes through `ReloadingFileProvider<YAMLSnapshot>`. The optional `APP_CONFIG_RELOAD_INTERVAL_SECONDS` environment variable controls the polling interval and defaults to `2` seconds.

Only the host-safe subset reloads live today:

- `app.name`
- `app.environment`
- `app.sseHeartbeatSeconds`
- `app.completedJobTTLSeconds`
- `app.completedJobMaxCount`
- `app.jobPruneIntervalSeconds`

Changes to bind addresses, ports, HTTP enablement, MCP enablement, MCP path, or MCP server metadata are detected and reported, but they still require a process restart before they can take effect.

The current HTTP surface is:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `GET /status`
- `GET /profiles`
- `GET /jobs`
- `GET /queue/generation`
- `GET /queue/playback`
- `GET /playback`
- `POST /profiles`
- `POST /playback/pause`
- `POST /playback/resume`
- `DELETE /profiles/{profile_name}`
- `DELETE /queue`
- `DELETE /queue/{request_id}`
- `POST /speak`
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}`
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/events`

`POST /speak`, `POST /profiles`, and `DELETE /profiles/{profile_name}` all return job metadata immediately. `POST /speak` mirrors the current public `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.speak(... as: .live)` path directly, which means every speech request records the initial acknowledgement event before it starts and eventually reaches terminal completion. `POST /speak` also accepts optional `cwd` and `repo_root` fields so clients can pass `SpeakSwiftly` normalization context through to the runtime when path-aware speech normalization matters. Progress, worker status changes, acknowledgements, and terminal results are exposed through `GET /jobs/{job_id}/events` as SSE, and retained job state is discoverable through `GET /jobs`.

The queue and playback control routes are immediate control operations rather than long-running jobs. `GET /queue/generation` and `GET /queue/playback` expose the generation and playback queues separately so the HTTP layer matches the runtime's split control surface. `GET /playback`, `POST /playback/pause`, and `POST /playback/resume` expose the current playback state and let clients control it directly. `DELETE /queue` clears queued work and returns the number of cancelled queued requests. `DELETE /queue/{request_id}` cancels one active or queued request and returns the cancelled request ID.

The route surface now mirrors the current `SpeakSwiftly` control model directly instead of preserving the older foreground/background split. The remaining alignment work is narrower: re-checking any app-facing payload details that still matter outside this repository and deciding whether any server-local transport shaping should disappear now that the public library surface is more expressive.

The current MCP surface is optional and mounts on the same shared Hummingbird process at `APP_MCP_PATH` when `APP_MCP_ENABLED=true`. It currently exposes these tools:

- `queue_speech_live`
- `create_profile`
- `list_profiles`
- `remove_profile`
- `list_queue_generation`
- `list_queue_playback`
- `playback_pause`
- `playback_resume`
- `playback_state`
- `clear_queue`
- `cancel_request`
- `status`

The embedded MCP resources are:

- `speak://status`
- `speak://profiles`
- `speak://profiles/{profile_name}/detail`
- `speak://jobs`
- `speak://jobs/{job_id}`
- `speak://runtime`

Those MCP tools and resources are intentionally thin adapters over the same `ServerHost` snapshots and mutations used by the HTTP API and the app-facing `ServerState`.

Accepted-job MCP tool results now return both `status_resource_uri` and a direct `job_resource_uri` so MCP clients can jump straight to one request's retained job detail.

The embedded MCP surface also now carries a small prompt catalog migrated from the standalone package where those prompts still map cleanly onto the shared host model:

- `draft_profile_voice_description`
- `draft_profile_source_text`
- `draft_voice_design_instruction`
- `draft_queue_playback_notice`

The embedded MCP surface now also supports resource subscriptions for those URIs. Clients connected to the standalone MCP event stream can subscribe to `speak://status`, `speak://profiles`, `speak://profiles/{profile_name}/detail`, `speak://jobs`, `speak://jobs/{job_id}`, and `speak://runtime` and receive `notifications/resources/updated` when shared host events change the underlying state.

Transport lifecycle snapshots are now intentionally tied to the shared Hummingbird process rather than static config alone. `listening` means the shared HTTP host has actually reached Hummingbird's `onServerRunning` boundary, so HTTP and MCP surface status now describe real network availability instead of only configuration intent.

The current HTTP SSE route remains intentionally job-specific at the route boundary, but it now rides the same host-owned event backbone used by other non-UI consumers instead of keeping a separate per-job subscriber registry inside `ServerHost`. That keeps the HTTP semantics stable while removing the last bespoke live-update path from the shared host.

## Development

The executable entrypoint lives in [`Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/SpeakSwiftlyServer.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/SpeakSwiftlyServer.swift). The shared host process stays intentionally small:

- [`HTTPSurface.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/HTTP/HTTPSurface.swift) assembles and conditionally mounts the HTTP surface on the shared Hummingbird server.
- [`MCPSurface.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/MCP/MCPSurface.swift) mounts the embedded MCP transport on that same shared process and registers tools and resources against `ServerHost`.
- [`MCPModels.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/MCP/MCPModels.swift) defines the thin MCP-specific catalog and result wrappers that stay at the transport edge.
- [`ServerHost.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Host/ServerHost.swift) owns runtime lifecycle, request orchestration, shared host state, and server-side update flow.
- [`ServerState.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Host/ServerState.swift) is the `@Observable` SwiftUI-facing projection of host state.
- [`HostStateModels.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Host/HostStateModels.swift) defines the shared host-native snapshots used by app UI, HTTP, and MCP consumers.
- [`HostEvents.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Host/HostEvents.swift) defines the typed host event surface used by non-UI consumers that need live change notifications without depending on SwiftUI observation.
- [`ServerRuntimeBridge.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Host/ServerRuntimeBridge.swift) keeps the runtime boundary thin around the public `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime` actor.
- [`ServerModels.swift`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Host/ServerModels.swift) defines request and response payloads.

The design is deliberately direct. Adding extra wrappers, managers, or intermediate layers here would be easy, but it would also be the kind of unnecessary complexity that makes a small localhost service harder to reason about, so the server is kept close to the typed runtime API on purpose. As of sibling `SpeakSwiftly v0.9.1`, that means the service talks to the public `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime` surface and its public event and summary types instead of reaching through the library boundary to construct raw worker requests itself.

## Verification

Current baseline checks:

```bash
swift build
swift test
```

The current automated suite covers configuration parsing, queued live speech job completion semantics, generation and playback queue inspection, playback control routes, queue cancellation routes, startup failure before readiness, runtime degradation while active and queued speech jobs are in flight, in-memory retention and pruning, SSE replay and heartbeat behavior, route-level health, profile, and job lifecycle responses against a controlled typed runtime, the embedded MCP tool and resource surface, the shared host snapshot stream and typed host event stream, plus an opt-in live end-to-end path against a real `SpeakSwiftly` runtime:

```bash
SPEAKSWIFTLYSERVER_E2E=1 swift test --filter SpeakSwiftlyServerE2ETests
```

There is also a second opt-in live pass that exercises the actual playback path instead of the silent playback controller. It still drives the full localhost HTTP surface, but it additionally waits for the runtime's structured `playback_engine_ready`, `playback_started`, and `playback_finished` log events:

```bash
SPEAKSWIFTLYSERVER_E2E=1 SPEAKSWIFTLYSERVER_E2E_REAL_PLAYBACK=1 swift test --filter SpeakSwiftlyServerE2ETests
```

If you want the underlying playback trace logs too, add `SPEAKSWIFTLY_PLAYBACK_TRACE=1`.

That live path expects the sibling [`SpeakSwiftly`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftly) checkout to have already been built with Xcode at least once so `../SpeakSwiftly/.derived/Build/Products/Debug/mlx-swift_Cmlx.bundle/Contents/Resources/default.metallib` exists for the server process.

The remaining coverage work is now narrower and more integration-focused. The main open checks are downstream payload-alignment expectations for adjacent consumers and any future end-to-end assertions that should exercise those consumers directly.
