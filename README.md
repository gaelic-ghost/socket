# productivity-skills

Curated Codex skills for productivity workflows, maintenance automation, and operational hygiene.

## What These Agent Skills Help With

This repository helps users and agents run recurring maintenance tasks with consistent guardrails and predictable outputs.

## Skill Guide (When To Use What)

- `docs-alignment-maintainer`
  - Use when you need workspace-wide docs drift checks and bounded docs fixes.
  - Helps by producing deterministic Markdown/JSON findings with safe remediation options.
- `skills-readme-alignment-maintainer`
  - Use when you need profile-aware README standards maintenance across `*-skills` repos.
  - Helps by normalizing structure and command integrity without touching code files.
- `project-roadmap-manager`
  - Use when you need a canonical `ROADMAP.md` workflow for milestones and accepted plans.
  - Helps by keeping project planning state explicit and current.
- `workspace-cleanup-audit`
  - Use when you need a read-only cleanup audit across workspace repos.
  - Helps by identifying artifact buildup and cleanup priorities.
- `things-week-ahead-digest`
  - Use when you want weekly planning summaries from Things data.
  - Helps by surfacing priorities and actionable next steps.
- `talktomepy-tts` (Deprecated)
  - Legacy TalkToMePy speech helper retained for backward compatibility.
  - New speech-focused workflows should use the successor path in [gaelic-ghost/a11y-skills](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/a11y-skills) instead.

## Notes

- Each skill includes `references/automation-prompts.md` templates for Codex App and Codex CLI automation usage.
- `docs-alignment-maintainer` is docs-focused only; AGENTS maintenance is intentionally out-of-scope.
- `talktomepy-tts` is deprecated; avoid new installs and prefer successor speech workflows in [gaelic-ghost/a11y-skills](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/a11y-skills).
