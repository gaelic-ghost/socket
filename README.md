## Overview

### Status

This project is actively available and stable enough to try.

### What This Project Is

`SpeakSwiftlyServer` is the standalone Swift Package Manager home for the local `SpeakSwiftly` server layer. It ships one reusable library target for embedding and one executable target, `SpeakSwiftlyServerTool`, for running the shared localhost service, LaunchAgent maintenance commands, and health checks.

The package exposes three user-facing surfaces:

- a localhost HTTP API for app and operator control
- an optional MCP surface for tool, resource, and prompt access
- a small embedded Apple-platform API centered on the public `EmbeddedServer` observable model

### Motivation

The goal is to give macOS and near-future Apple-platform apps one small, typed local speech-service layer without adding a second runtime stack or forcing every consumer to rebuild the same transport and lifecycle glue around `SpeakSwiftly`.

## Quick Start

Build the package with Xcode's selected Swift toolchain:

```bash
xcrun swift build
```

Run the shared server executable locally:

```bash
xcrun swift run SpeakSwiftlyServerTool
```

Check the current operator surface:

```bash
xcrun swift run SpeakSwiftlyServerTool help
xcrun swift run SpeakSwiftlyServerTool healthcheck --base-url http://127.0.0.1:7338
```

For contributor setup, validation, release workflow, and live end-to-end coverage, use [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Usage

Run the server directly in the foreground:

```bash
xcrun swift run SpeakSwiftlyServerTool serve
```

Install or refresh the per-user LaunchAgent with a config file:

This command expects the staged tool artifact to already exist at `.release-artifacts/current/SpeakSwiftlyServerTool`. On a clean checkout, build and stage the release artifact first, or pass `--tool-executable-path /absolute/path/to/SpeakSwiftlyServerTool` explicitly.

```bash
xcrun swift run SpeakSwiftlyServerTool launch-agent install \
  --config-file ./server.yaml
```

Promote the current checkout into the live LaunchAgent-backed service:

```bash
xcrun swift run SpeakSwiftlyServerTool launch-agent promote-live \
  --config-file ./server.yaml
```

Inspect or remove the installed LaunchAgent:

```bash
xcrun swift run SpeakSwiftlyServerTool launch-agent status
xcrun swift run SpeakSwiftlyServerTool launch-agent uninstall
```

The package uses distinct default localhost ports by entrypoint:

- direct executable startup defaults to `127.0.0.1:7338`
- LaunchAgent installs default to `127.0.0.1:7337`
- embedded app-owned sessions default to `127.0.0.1:7339`

The full transport contract lives in [API.md](./API.md).

## Embedding

The supported public embedding surface is `EmbeddedServer`, defined in [Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Host/ServerState.swift](./Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Host/ServerState.swift). App code owns that one observable object directly, calls `liftoff()`, binds UI to its observable properties, and uses the same object for runtime controls, playback controls, voice-profile actions, and direct live speech submission through `queueLiveSpeech(...)`, including the shared `SpeakSwiftly.RequestContext` metadata model when one request needs caller-origin details.

```swift
import SpeakSwiftlyServer
import SwiftUI

@main
struct ExampleApp: App {
    @State private var server = EmbeddedServer(
        options: .init(
            port: 7811,
            runtimeProfileRootURL: FileManager.default
                .urls(for: .applicationSupportDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
                .first?
                .appendingPathComponent("ExampleApp/SpeakSwiftlyRuntime", isDirectory: true)
        )
    )

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView(server: server)
                .task {
                    try? await server.liftoff()
                }
        }
    }
}
```

If you do not pass `EmbeddedServer.Options(port:)`, the embedded host defaults to `127.0.0.1:7339`. If you pass `EmbeddedServer.Options(runtimeProfileRootURL:)`, the server treats that as its profile-store root and bridges it at startup into the broader persistence root expected by the current pinned `SpeakSwiftly` runtime, while keeping the server's own runtime-configuration snapshot aligned with the same on-disk state.

## Configuration

The shared server supports these environment variables:

- `APP_CONFIG_FILE`
- `APP_NAME`
- `APP_ENVIRONMENT`
- `APP_DEFAULT_VOICE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `APP_HOST`
- `APP_PORT`
- `APP_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`
- `APP_COMPLETED_JOB_TTL_SECONDS`
- `APP_COMPLETED_JOB_MAX_COUNT`
- `APP_JOB_PRUNE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
- `APP_HTTP_ENABLED`
- `APP_HTTP_HOST`
- `APP_HTTP_PORT`
- `APP_HTTP_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`
- `APP_MCP_ENABLED`
- `APP_MCP_PATH`
- `APP_MCP_SERVER_NAME`
- `APP_MCP_TITLE`
- `SPEAKSWIFTLY_PROFILE_ROOT`

If `APP_CONFIG_FILE` points at a YAML file, the server loads it through [swift-configuration](https://github.com/apple/swift-configuration), with environment variables taking precedence over YAML and YAML taking precedence over built-in defaults.

```yaml
app:
  name: speak-swiftly-server
  environment: development
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 7338
  sseHeartbeatSeconds: 10
  completedJobTTLSeconds: 900
  completedJobMaxCount: 200
  jobPruneIntervalSeconds: 60
  http:
    enabled: true
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 7338
    sseHeartbeatSeconds: 10
  mcp:
    enabled: false
    path: /mcp
    serverName: speak-swiftly-mcp
    title: Speak Swiftly
```

The app-managed install layout is centered on one per-user location under `~/Library/Application Support/SpeakSwiftlyServer`, with logs in `~/Library/Logs/SpeakSwiftlyServer`. The package exposes that layout directly through [AppManagedInstallLayout.swift](./Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/AppManagedInstallLayout.swift).

## Codex Plugin

This repository is also packaged as a repo-local Codex plugin through [`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](./.codex-plugin/plugin.json). The plugin points at the checked-in [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json) connection for the local `speak_swiftly` MCP server and the tracked [skills](./skills/) bundle that teaches Codex how to use the surface intentionally.

The first plugin pass ships focused skills for:

- broad MCP orientation
- LaunchAgent setup and maintenance
- runtime, playback, and queue control
- voice workflows
- text-profile workflows

## Development

The contributor and maintainer workflow lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Use that guide for:

- local setup and runtime expectations
- validation commands
- live end-to-end coverage
- pull request and release workflow
- monorepo and submodule handoff rules

The short version is:

- use `xcrun swift test` for the normal package-development loop
- use `sh scripts/repo-maintenance/validate-all.sh` for the full maintainer and CI gate
- use `scripts/repo-maintenance/release-prepare.sh` only for branch-side PR prep
- use `scripts/repo-maintenance/release-publish.sh` as the single publish-time artifact and tag path
