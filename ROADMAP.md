# ROADMAP

## Current Release Gate: v1.0.0

- [x] Document the app-managed install and configuration contract the macOS app will rely on.
- [x] Decide and document how app-managed installs own logs, profile roots, and cache paths.
- [x] Trim the roadmap so the remaining unchecked items are clearly split between the v1.0.0 gate and post-1.0 follow-up work.

## Milestone 1: Bootstrap And Repo Hygiene

- [x] Scaffold the Swift executable package.
- [x] Add project-level guidance in `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] Write an initial `README.md` that reflects the real current state.
- [x] Add a project license.
- [x] Replace the placeholder executable body with the first real server startup path.

## Milestone 2: Hummingbird HTTP Server

- [x] Add Hummingbird as the HTTP server dependency.
- [x] Implement a localhost server configuration model for host, port, and runtime settings.
- [x] Implement `GET /healthz`.
- [x] Implement `GET /readyz`.
- [x] Implement `GET /status`.
- [x] Implement `GET /profiles`.
- [x] Implement `POST /profiles`.
- [x] Implement `DELETE /profiles/{profile_name}`.
- [x] Implement `POST /speak`.
- [x] Implement `GET /queue/generation`.
- [x] Implement `GET /queue/playback`.
- [x] Implement `GET /playback`.
- [x] Implement `POST /playback/pause`.
- [x] Implement `POST /playback/resume`.
- [x] Implement `DELETE /queue`.
- [x] Implement `DELETE /queue/{request_id}`.
- [x] Implement `GET /jobs/{job_id}`.
- [x] Implement `GET /jobs/{job_id}/events`.
- [x] Implement SSE heartbeats and replay behavior for the app-facing job stream.

## Milestone 3: SpeakSwiftly Integration

- [x] Decide and implement the first integration path to `SpeakSwiftly`.
- [x] Switch the server to direct typed `SpeakSwiftly` import instead of subprocess-backed integration.
- [x] Surface operator-facing startup, readiness, and worker failure details clearly.
- [x] Support profile cache refresh and reconciliation behavior after profile mutations.
- [x] Keep the standalone HTTP and MCP contracts aligned with the current in-repo host model even when no downstream consumer repository exists yet.

## Milestone 4: Testing And Verification

- [x] Replace the generated placeholder test with real package coverage.
- [x] Add unit tests for configuration and settings loading.
- [x] Add unit tests for in-memory job retention and pruning.
- [x] Add route tests for health, readiness, profile, and job endpoints.
- [x] Add SSE tests for initial worker status replay, progress history, and keep-alive behavior.
- [x] Add end-to-end verification against a real `SpeakSwiftly` runtime.
- [x] Add an opt-in end-to-end verification path that exercises real playback instead of silent playback.
- [x] Add failure-path tests for worker startup failure before the runtime ever becomes ready.
- [x] Add failure-path tests for runtime degradation while queued live speech is still in flight.

## Milestone 5: Library Integration Follow-Through

- [x] Split `../SpeakSwiftly` so it vends a reusable library product alongside its executable product.
- [x] Switch this package from subprocess-style integration to direct `SpeakSwiftly` package import when that library product exists.
- [x] Collapse temporary integration-only scaffolding that became unnecessary after direct import.
- [x] Align the runtime bridge with the public `SpeakSwiftly` library surface instead of constructing raw worker requests across the library boundary.
- [x] Re-align this package with the repackaged `SpeakSwiftly` plus direct `TextForSpeech` dependency surface so `swift build` and `swift test` work against the current sibling checkout again.
- [x] Adopt the updated `SpeakSwiftly.Runtime.speak(..., textProfileName:textContext:id:)` signature and remove assumptions about older normalization-only entrypoints.
- [x] Add the new voice-clone creation flow across host, HTTP, MCP, and tests.
- [x] Expose the new text-profile inspection and editing helpers across HTTP and MCP with a transport model that stays distinct from stored voice-profile jobs.
- [x] Keep the public speech submission surface aligned with the evolving `SpeakSwiftly` library API, including stored text-profile selection on one-shot speech requests.
- [x] Expand MCP prompts and resources so downstream apps and agents get first-class guidance for authoring and using SpeakSwiftly text profiles and replacements.
- [x] Remove any remaining server-local transport translation that `SpeakSwiftly` can now express directly without making the server harder to reason about.
- [x] Re-check the host bridge and docs against the current sibling `SpeakSwiftly` public library surface.

## Milestone 6: App And LaunchAgent Handoff

- [x] Document the app-managed install and configuration contract the forthcoming macOS app will need.
- [x] Add any server-side hooks needed for LaunchAgent-friendly lifecycle management.
- [x] Decide how logs, profile roots, and cache paths should be configured and owned for app-managed installs.
- [x] Prepare an initial tagged release once the service is meaningfully usable.

## Milestone 7: Live Update Convergence

- [x] Decide how much of the existing `GET /jobs/{job_id}/events` SSE route should stay job-specific versus begin consuming the shared host event surface.
- [x] Converge HTTP SSE onto the host event model selectively, only where it removes bespoke stream plumbing without losing clear per-job semantics.
- [x] Revisit whether playback-job MCP resources have become natural shared-host concepts after the adjacent `SpeakSwiftly` API layer stabilizes.
- [x] Re-evaluate whether any standalone MCP prompt-catalog concepts still earn migration once the shared host update model is more mature.
- [x] Define explicit live config reload boundaries only after the transport and event surfaces stop shifting.

## Milestone 8: Config Reload Policy

Post-1.0 note: these are important transport-policy decisions, but they are not part of the current `v1.0.0` release gate.

- [x] Adopt `swift-configuration` reloading providers for YAML-backed server config.
- [x] Keep malformed reloads non-fatal so the watcher survives bad file edits.
- [x] Apply the safe host-level subset live through `ServerHost`.
- [x] Surface restart-required config changes through the shared recent-error model.
- [ ] Decide whether transport bind settings should remain restart-only permanently or earn a coordinated live-rebind model later.

## Milestone 9: Formatting And Linting

Post-1.0 note: repo-discipline and CI-hardening work, not a current product-correctness blocker for `v1.0.0`.

- [ ] Add SwiftFormat configuration and a maintainer-facing formatting command.
- [ ] Decide whether SwiftLint should join SwiftFormat as a required local and CI check.
- [ ] Wire the chosen formatting and linting checks into repo-maintenance validation and GitHub Actions.

## Milestone 10: Swift Package Index Readiness

Post-1.0 note: distribution polish for discovery and packaging, not part of the current `v1.0.0` gate.

- [ ] Add a project `.spi.yml` file with an intentionally minimal initial configuration.
- [ ] Re-check README, package metadata, and release guidance against Swift Package Index expectations after `.spi.yml` lands.
- [ ] Submit the package to Swift Package Index once license, metadata, and CI state are ready.

## Milestone 11: SpeakSwiftly v0.11 Surface Adoption

Post-1.0 note: this is the current alignment plan for the newer `SpeakSwiftly` runtime surface after the dependency bump to `0.11.0`.

- [x] Bump the resolved `SpeakSwiftly` dependency to `0.11.0` and carry explicit `vibe` through the existing profile and clone creation surfaces instead of preserving the older implicit-profile behavior.
- [x] Expose the persisted `SpeakSwiftly.Configuration` surface across host state, HTTP, and MCP so operators can inspect and change the active speech backend without reaching into the runtime process manually.
- [ ] Debug the queued-Marvis live playback E2E stall in `httpMarvisQueuedLivePlaybackDrainsInOrder`, including the stuck first request terminal state and the generation-versus-playback ordering mismatch captured in `docs/maintainers/e2e-marvis-queued-live-investigation.md`.
- [ ] Re-check the server against Gale's forthcoming `SpeakSwiftly` simplification work and delete any remaining local queue, playback, or host-state inference that upstream can now expose directly in a clearer typed form.
- [ ] Add generated-file reads across host, HTTP, MCP, and shared resources so saved artifacts can be listed and fetched through the server instead of only inside the sibling library.
- [ ] Add generation-job reads and expiry controls across host, HTTP, MCP, and shared resources so persisted file and batch jobs can be inspected and managed directly.
- [ ] Add batch-generation submission plus batch-read surfaces across host, HTTP, MCP, and shared resources, including artifact-id shaping and the existing text-format / source-format context support for each batch item.
- [ ] Revisit server-local job and snapshot shaping so the new immediate generation-control operations and persisted generation-job reads map directly to runtime concepts instead of keeping legacy server-only wrappers around them.
- [ ] Expand README, MCP tool docs, shared resources, and opt-in live E2E coverage so `marvis` vs `qwen3`, explicit `vibe`, generated files, generation jobs, and batch generation are all documented and verified end to end.
