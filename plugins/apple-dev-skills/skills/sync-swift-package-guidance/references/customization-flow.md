# Swift Package Guidance Sync Customization Contract

## Purpose

Adjust the documented guidance-sync defaults while keeping runtime behavior grounded in the actual wrapper and implementation scripts.

## Knobs

| Knob | Default | Status | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `writeMode` | `sync-if-needed` | `runtime-enforced` | Controls whether the workflow may create missing `AGENTS.md`, append the bounded Swift package section, or stay report-only. |

## Runtime Behavior

- `scripts/customization_config.py` reads, writes, resets, and reports customization state.
- `scripts/run_workflow.py` loads the effective merged customization state at runtime.
- Both Python entrypoints are `uv` scripts with inline `PyYAML` dependency metadata.
- In consuming repos, prefer `uv run scripts/customization_config.py ...` and `uv run scripts/run_workflow.py ...` so YAML support is provisioned correctly.
- Post-sync validation remains a workflow invariant unless the user explicitly passes `--skip-validation`.
- `scripts/sync_swift_package_guidance.py` remains the implementation core for the current guidance-sync path.

## Update Flow

1. Inspect current settings with `scripts/customization_config.py effective`.
   Supported invocation: `uv run scripts/customization_config.py effective`
2. Update `SKILL.md`, `assets/AGENTS.md`, and `assets/append-section.md` to reflect the approved policy change.
3. Persist the metadata change with `scripts/customization_config.py apply --input <yaml-file>`.
4. Re-run `scripts/customization_config.py effective` and confirm the stored values match the docs.
5. Use `scripts/customization_config.py reset` only when the user explicitly wants to clear customization state.
6. Verify runtime defaults with `uv run scripts/run_workflow.py --repo-root . --dry-run`.

## Validation

1. Run the workflow once with `--dry-run`.
2. Run the workflow once on a repo with no `AGENTS.md`.
3. Run the workflow once on a repo with an existing `AGENTS.md` that lacks the Swift package section.
4. Verify `scripts/run_workflow.py` reflects the runtime-enforced knobs above.
