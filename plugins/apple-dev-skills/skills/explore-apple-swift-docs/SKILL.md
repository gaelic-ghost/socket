name: explore-apple-swift-docs
description: Explore Apple and Swift documentation across Xcode MCP docs, Dash, and official web docs, including search, browse, source selection, local-docs fallback, and optional Dash install or generation follow-up. Use when Codex needs Apple or Swift docs help rather than Xcode execution or repo-guidance sync work.

# Explore Apple Swift Docs

## Purpose

Explore Apple and Swift documentation through one top-level entry point. Prefer direct docs access methods in this order: Xcode MCP docs first, Dash MCP second, Dash localhost HTTP third, and official web docs last. `scripts/run_workflow.py` remains a maintainer helper for structured dry runs, fallback planning, and Dash follow-up automation, but it is not the primary way the agent should perform ordinary Apple or Swift docs lookup.

## When To Use

- Use this skill for Apple or Swift API reference lookup requests.
- Use this skill for Apple or Swift guide, tutorial, symbol, or concept search requests.
- Use this skill when the user wants local docs first, wants official docs first, or wants to compare available Apple or Swift docs sources.
- Use this skill when the user wants Dash-compatible Apple or Swift docs access, install guidance for a missing Dash docset, or generation guidance when a Dash docset is unavailable.
- Recommend `xcode-build-run-workflow` when the user needs Apple or Swift execution, diagnostics, build, run, toolchain help, or mutation decisions inside an existing Xcode project.
- Recommend `xcode-testing-workflow` when the user needs Swift Testing, XCTest, XCUITest, `.xctestplan`, or test diagnosis inside an existing Xcode project.
- Recommend `bootstrap-xcode-app-project` when the user is starting a brand new native Apple app project.
- Recommend `sync-xcode-project-guidance` when an existing Xcode app repo needs `AGENTS.md` or workflow-guidance alignment rather than docs exploration.

## Single-Path Workflow

1. Classify the request into one docs workflow mode:
   - `explore`
   - `dash-install`
   - `dash-generate`
2. If no mode is explicit, start at `explore`.
3. For `explore`, use the documented direct docs path instead of routing ordinary lookups through a wrapper script:
   - `xcode-mcp-docs`: use Xcode MCP docs tools first when they are available and the user has not asked for another source
   - `dash`: use Dash MCP tools directly when local Dash coverage is wanted and the MCP service is available
   - `dash-http`: use the documented Dash localhost HTTP structure directly when Dash MCP is unavailable or incomplete
   - `official-web`: use official Apple or Swift web docs when the local-docs paths are unavailable or the user explicitly prefers the web source
4. Use `scripts/run_workflow.py` only when a structured non-interactive planning result is useful, or when the request is specifically about `dash-install` or `dash-generate` follow-up behavior.
5. If the selected mode cannot complete, hand off forward through one clear next step:
   - `explore -> dash-install`
   - `dash-install -> dash-generate`
6. Return one `status`, one `path_type`, one `source_used`, and one output contract for the mode that ran.

## Inputs

- `mode`: `explore`, `dash-install`, or `dash-generate`
- `query`: required for `explore`
- `docs_kind`: optional for `explore`; use `api-reference`, `guide`, `symbol`, or `search` when the user intent is clear
- `preferred_source`: optional for `explore`; use `auto`, `xcode-mcp-docs`, `dash`, or `official-web`
- `mcp_failure_reason`: optional for `explore` when Xcode MCP docs were expected but are currently unavailable
- `docset_request`: required for `dash-install` and `dash-generate`
- `approval`: required before side-effectful Dash install actions
- Defaults:
  - `explore` source order is `xcode-mcp-docs,dash,official-web`
  - Dash install source priority is `built-in,user-contributed,cheatsheet`
  - default search result limit is `20`
  - default search snippets setting is `true`
  - maintainer helper entrypoint: executable `scripts/run_workflow.py`

## Outputs

- `status`
  - `success`: the selected mode completed on its primary or fallback path
  - `blocked`: prerequisites, approval, or usable docs sources are missing
  - `handoff`: the current mode is handing off to the next docs mode
- `path_type`
  - `primary`: the selected mode completed normally
  - `fallback`: the selected mode completed through its documented fallback path
- `output`
  - `mode`
  - `source_used`
  - `configured_order` or `source_path`
  - `matches`
  - install result or generation guidance when applicable
  - one next step when follow-up is required

## Guards and Stop Conditions

- Do not run Dash install actions without explicit user approval.
- Do not invent Apple or Swift doc sources, Dash identifiers, or catalog matches.
- Do not present `scripts/run_workflow.py` as the required first step for ordinary Apple or Swift docs lookup when direct Xcode MCP or Dash MCP/HTTP access is available.
- Stop with `blocked` when `explore` has no usable docs source after applying the documented fallback order.
- Stop with `blocked` when `dash-install` or `dash-generate` lacks a concrete docset request.
- Keep `explore`, `dash-install`, and `dash-generate` in forward order; do not blend them into competing primary workflows.

## Fallbacks and Handoffs

- `explore` falls back in this order: Xcode MCP docs, then Dash MCP, then Dash localhost HTTP, then official web docs.
- Explicit user preference overrides the default source order when that preference is usable.
- `dash-install` hands off to `dash-generate` when no installable catalog match exists.
- `dash-generate` falls back from stable automation guidance to deterministic manual guidance.
- Recommend `xcode-build-run-workflow` directly when the user’s task shifts from docs exploration to Apple or Swift build, run, diagnostics, toolchain, or mutation work.
- Recommend `xcode-testing-workflow` directly when the user’s task shifts from docs exploration to Apple or Swift test work.
- Recommend `bootstrap-xcode-app-project` directly when the user needs new native app scaffolding.
- Recommend `sync-xcode-project-guidance` directly when an existing Xcode app repo needs guidance sync rather than docs help.
- `scripts/run_workflow.py` is the shared local helper for structured planning, install gating, and follow-up behavior; helper scripts remain implementation details behind it.

## Customization

- Use `references/customization-flow.md`.
- `scripts/customization_config.py` stores and reports customization state.
- `scripts/run_workflow.py` loads and enforces the runtime-safe knobs documented in `references/customization-flow.md`.
