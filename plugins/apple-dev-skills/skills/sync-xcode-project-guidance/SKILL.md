name: sync-xcode-project-guidance
description: Sync repo guidance for an existing native Apple app repository managed through Xcode when the user wants to add, merge, refresh, or align AGENTS.md and project workflow guidance. Use for existing macOS, iOS, or iPadOS app repos with an .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace. Do not use for brand-new app bootstrap or plain Swift packages.

# Sync Xcode Project Guidance

## Purpose

Bring an existing Xcode app repository up to the expected guidance baseline without overloading the main Xcode execution skill. This skill owns repo-guidance alignment for existing Apple app repos, including deterministic `AGENTS.md` creation or bounded section append behavior, and runs `maintain-project-repo` with the `xcode-app` profile alongside that guidance. `scripts/run_workflow.py` is the runtime entrypoint, and `scripts/sync_xcode_project_guidance.py` applies the current sync behavior.

## When To Use

- Use this skill when an existing macOS, iOS, or iPadOS app repo needs `AGENTS.md` added, refreshed, or merged with the current Xcode workflow baseline.
- Use this skill when the repository already has an `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` and the user wants project guidance, onboarding rules, or workflow policy brought up to date.
- Use this skill when the user wants the repo guidance for the current narrower Xcode execution skills to be made explicit in the repo itself.
- Do not use this skill for new-project creation from nothing.
- Do not use this skill for ordinary build, test, run, diagnostics, docs lookup, or mutation work inside an existing Xcode project.
- Do not use this skill for plain Swift packages, libraries, or tools that are not native Apple apps.
- Recommend `bootstrap-xcode-app-project` when the repo does not exist yet.
- Recommend `xcode-build-run-workflow` when the task is active Xcode execution, diagnostics, docs lookup, previews, file-membership follow-through, or mutation work inside an existing Xcode project.
- Recommend `xcode-testing-workflow` when the task is primarily about Swift Testing, XCTest, XCUITest, `.xctestplan`, or test diagnosis inside an existing Xcode project.
- Recommend `sync-swift-package-guidance` when the repo is a plain Swift package instead of an Xcode app project.
- After updating this plugin's Xcode-policy surfaces, recommend rerunning `sync-xcode-project-guidance` in downstream repos so their `AGENTS.md` and `maintain-project-repo` output stay aligned.
- For maintainer notes about this repository itself, say plainly that the repo exports from top-level `skills/` today and does not ship repo-local installer workflows.

## Single-Path Workflow

1. Collect the required inputs:
   - `repo_root`
   - optional `workspace_path`
   - optional `skip_validation`
   - optional `dry_run`
2. Classify the request as existing Xcode app-repo guidance sync before continuing:
   - continue only when the repo already contains an `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`
   - stop if the request is really new-project bootstrap or SwiftPM-only guidance sync
3. Apply the Apple docs gate before shaping workflow guidance:
   - read the relevant Apple documentation first
   - prefer Dash or local Apple docs first, then official Apple web docs when needed
   - state the documented workflow boundary being relied on before proposing repo guidance changes
   - current documented anchors for this workflow include:
     - Apple's Xcode project-creation guidance: [Creating an Xcode project for an app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating_an_xcode_project_for_an_app)
     - SwiftUI app lifecycle guidance through the `App` protocol: [App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app)
     - scene composition guidance through `Scene` and `WindowGroup`: [Scene](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scene) and [WindowGroup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/windowgroup)
   - if the docs and the current guidance template conflict, stop and report that conflict
   - if no relevant Apple docs can be found, say that explicitly before proceeding
4. Apply the shared Xcode-project policy before making repo-guidance changes:
   - apply the detailed local policy in `references/snippets/apple-xcode-project-core.md`
   - preserve its simplicity-first Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode-managed project, test-plan, file-membership, and Debug/Release guidance
5. Run `scripts/run_workflow.py` to normalize inputs, detect whether the repo is really Xcode-managed, and shape the sync plan.
6. Apply the sync path:
   - if `AGENTS.md` is missing, copy `assets/AGENTS.md`
   - if `AGENTS.md` exists and already contains the managed section, keep the file unchanged
   - if `AGENTS.md` exists but lacks the managed section, append `assets/append-section.md` as a bounded section
7. Validate the synced repo guidance:
   - verify `AGENTS.md` exists
   - verify the synced file mentions `xcode-build-run-workflow` and `xcode-testing-workflow`
   - verify the synced file preserves the no-direct-`.pbxproj` rule
8. Refresh `maintain-project-repo`:
   - refresh `scripts/repo-maintenance/`
   - refresh `.github/workflows/validate-repo-maintenance.yml`
   - preserve repo-specific extra scripts that are not part of the managed file set
9. Verify the synced maintenance guidance still points at the expected maintainer files:
   - `.swiftformat`
   - `scripts/repo-maintenance/hooks/pre-commit.sample`
   - `scripts/repo-maintenance/validate-all.sh`
   - `scripts/repo-maintenance/sync-shared.sh`
   - `scripts/repo-maintenance/release.sh`
   - protected branches, when configured, require the GitHub Actions check context `validate` rather than `Validate Repo Maintenance / validate`
10. Hand off ongoing engineering work cleanly:
   - recommend `xcode-build-run-workflow` or `xcode-testing-workflow` for active Xcode collaboration after the repo guidance is aligned
   - recommend `bootstrap-xcode-app-project` only when the user actually needs a fresh repo instead of guidance sync

## Inputs

- `repo_root`: optional absolute or relative path to the repository root; defaults to `.`
- `workspace_path`: optional path used only to improve Xcode-project discovery when repo-root detection is ambiguous
- `skip_validation`: optional flag to skip post-sync file validation
- `dry_run`: optional flag to emit the planned contract without writing files
- Defaults:
  - runtime entrypoint: executable `scripts/run_workflow.py`
  - `repo_root=.` when omitted
  - `writeMode=sync-if-needed`
  - validation runs unless `--skip-validation` is passed
  - successful mutating runs refresh `maintain-project-repo` output in place

## Outputs

- `status`
  - `success`: guidance sync completed or was already satisfied
  - `blocked`: prerequisites, repo classification, or sync policy prevented completion
  - `failed`: the sync path started but did not complete successfully
- `path_type`
  - `primary`: the documented sync path completed
  - `fallback`: a non-mutating guided result was returned
- `output`
  - resolved repo root
  - detected workspace or project markers
  - `AGENTS.md` path
  - actions applied or planned
  - refreshed `maintain-project-repo` paths
  - validation result
  - one concise next step or handoff

## Guards and Stop Conditions

- Stop with `blocked` if the repo root cannot be resolved.
- Stop with `blocked` if the repo does not contain an `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`.
- Stop with `blocked` if the repo appears to be a SwiftPM-only package without Xcode-managed app markers.
- Stop with `blocked` if the chosen `writeMode` does not allow the mutation the repo still needs, such as creating a missing `AGENTS.md` or appending the bounded Xcode guidance section.
- Stop with `blocked` if the target `AGENTS.md` path exists but is not a regular file.

## Fallbacks and Handoffs

- The only current fallback is a non-mutating dry-run or guided result that explains what the sync would do.
- After a successful sync, hand off ongoing build, run, diagnostics, preview, and mutation work to `xcode-build-run-workflow`.
- After a successful sync, hand off ongoing test execution and test diagnosis work to `xcode-testing-workflow`.
- After a successful sync, use `scripts/repo-maintenance/validate-all.sh` for local maintainer validation and `scripts/repo-maintenance/release.sh --mode standard --version vX.Y.Z` from a feature branch or worktree for protected-main releases.
- After a successful sync, configure protected branches to require `validate` for the managed repo-maintenance workflow; GitHub exposes that job check context directly rather than the workflow title plus job string.
- Recommend `bootstrap-xcode-app-project` when the repository still needs to be created from scratch.
- Recommend `sync-swift-package-guidance` when the repo is a plain Swift package rather than an Xcode app project.

## Customization

- Use `references/customization-flow.md`.
- `scripts/customization_config.py` stores and reports customization state.
- `scripts/run_workflow.py` loads runtime-safe defaults from customization state before invoking the supported sync path.
- The current runtime-enforced customization surface is one `writeMode` knob that controls whether the workflow may create missing `AGENTS.md`, append the bounded Xcode section, or stay report-only.
- Run the Python wrapper and customization entrypoints through `uv`, because they rely on inline `PyYAML` script metadata rather than a repo-global Python environment.
- In consuming repos, the supported path is `uv run scripts/run_workflow.py ...` and `uv run scripts/customization_config.py ...`; do not assume plain `python` or `python3` will have the needed YAML dependency installed.
