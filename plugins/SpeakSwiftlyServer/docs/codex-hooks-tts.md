# Codex Hooks TTS

SpeakSwiftlyServer ships a Codex lifecycle hook that can speak final assistant
replies through the local `SpeakSwiftlyServer` HTTP surface.

The user-facing install path is plugin-managed. The repository-local `.codex/`
files are only a development and testing harness for this checkout.

## User Install Surface

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
  Declares `hooks: "./hooks/hooks.json"` so installed plugin users get the
  lifecycle config from the plugin.
- `hooks/hooks.json`
  Registers one `Stop` hook handler.
- `hooks/stop-tts.mjs`
  Reads the Codex `Stop` payload from `stdin`, skips empty or duplicate turns,
  ignores continuation passes by default, and queues speech through the local
  `SpeakSwiftlyServer` HTTP route at `POST /speech/live`.

The plugin-managed hook stores state and logs under
`~/.codex/speak-swiftly-server/hooks/` by default, or under `CODEX_HOME` when
that environment variable points Codex at a different home directory.

## Development Harness

- `.codex/config.toml`
  Enables `features.codex_hooks = true` for this trusted project and wires a
  `notify` probe command.
- `.codex/hooks.json`
  Registers the same `Stop` hook script for local testing, with
  `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_DATA_DIR` pointed at this checkout's `.codex/` directory.
- `.codex/hooks/stop-tts.mjs`
  Dev-only forwarding entrypoint for older local configs that still point at
  the pre-plugin hook path. It keeps existing developer sessions from failing
  while the doctor reports that the global hook should be migrated away.
- `.codex/hooks/notify-dump.mjs`
  Records whatever Codex passes to the `notify` command so maintainers can
  inspect the real payload shape.
- `.codex/logs/stop-tts.jsonl`
  Runtime log for queued, skipped, and failed development-harness TTS attempts.
- `.codex/logs/notify-events.jsonl`
  Runtime log for `notify` payload inspection.
- `.codex/state/stop-tts-seen-turns.json`
  Development-harness dedupe state keyed by `session_id + turn_id`.

Do not tell end users to copy `.codex/hooks.json` or `.codex/config.toml` into
their own Codex home. That creates a second hook source and can make Codex
launch duplicate `Stop` hook processes. Use the plugin install flow instead.

## Environment Overrides

The `Stop` hook script accepts these optional environment overrides:

- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_BASE_URL`
  Override the default `http://127.0.0.1:7337`.
- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_PROFILE_NAME`
  Override the default voice profile name `default-femme`.
- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_DATA_DIR`
  Override the state and log root. The hook creates `state/` and `logs/` under
  this directory.
- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_SKIP_CONTINUATIONS`
  Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` if continued `Stop` turns should be read
  aloud too.
- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_SKIP_STRUCTURED_MESSAGES`
  Defaults to `true`. Skips compact structured assistant payloads such as
  `{"title":"..."}`, `{"suggestions":[...]}`, and `{"exclude":[...]}` because
  those are UI or automation metadata rather than speakable final prose.
- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_LOG_FULL_PAYLOAD`
  Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` only during focused debugging when the log
  needs the full raw Codex hook payload and parsed payload.
- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_MAX_SEEN_TURNS`
  Controls how many dedupe keys are retained in the local state file.
- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_STATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`
  Defaults to `3000`. Controls how long a hook process waits for the local
  dedupe-state lock before logging an unexpected hook failure.
- `CODEX_HOOK_TTS_STATE_LOCK_POLL_MS`
  Defaults to `50`. Controls how frequently a waiting hook process retries the
  local dedupe-state lock.

## Doctor

Run this from the repository root when hook behavior or voice selection looks
off:

```bash
node scripts/codex-hooks-doctor.mjs
```

The doctor reports:

- repo plugin hook metadata
- repo development-harness hook metadata
- legacy global `~/.codex/hooks.json` entries that still point at SpeakSwiftly
- installed plugin-cache manifests and whether they declare hooks
- `codex_hooks = true` and the enabled `speak-swiftly-server@socket` plugin
- live runtime reachability through `GET /runtime/host`
- runtime default voice profile versus the hook's configured profile
- cached voice profiles
- recent plugin-managed and repo-local hook log outcomes

Warnings are expected during migration if a legacy global hook is still active
or the installed plugin cache has not yet been upgraded to a version that
declares plugin-managed hooks.

## Runtime Insights

- `Stop` is the right TTS trigger because it carries the final assistant text
  in `last_assistant_message`.
- `notify` is a useful payload probe, but observed Desktop notify commands can
  run with process `cwd` as `/`; use the event's own `cwd` field when
  interpreting where the turn happened.
- Duplicate `Stop` invocations can happen for the same `session_id + turn_id`
  when multiple hook sources match. The hook reserves a turn before posting to
  the speech route so duplicate processes do not queue duplicate audio jobs.
- Some assistant messages are compact JSON metadata used by Codex UI or
  automation flows. Those should be logged and skipped, not spoken aloud.
- The speech route distinguishes a reachable-but-not-ready runtime from an
  unreachable runtime:
  - HTTP `503` with `SpeakSwiftly is not ready yet...` means the server is up
    but not accepting speech work.
  - `speech-route-unreachable` means the hook could not reach the local
    `SpeakSwiftlyServer` route at all.

The hook sends `request_context` with each queued speech request. That keeps
Codex-originated speech inspectable through the existing `SpeakSwiftlyServer`
request model without adding a hook-specific server API. The context includes
the Codex model, permission mode, transcript path, session id, turn id, and
event name when those fields are available.

## Validation Notes

The hook matches the current official Codex hooks payload shape:

- `Stop` receives one JSON object on `stdin`, including `turn_id`,
  `stop_hook_active`, and `last_assistant_message`.
- `Stop` must not emit plain text on `stdout`.
- Commands run with the session `cwd`, so repo-local development hooks resolve
  through `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and plugin hooks keep their command
  path relative to the plugin lifecycle config.
- `notify` is a top-level Codex configuration command that receives a JSON
  payload from Codex; it is not nested under `[features]`.

Observed current behavior in this repo's live Codex TUI runs:

- the `Stop` hook payload arrives on `stdin`
- the `notify` command currently arrives as one JSON command-line argument
- the current notify runs observed here did not include any `stdin` payload

The `notify` probe still logs both the documented JSON argument and any `stdin`
payload so future Codex surfaces can be compared without rewriting the hook.
