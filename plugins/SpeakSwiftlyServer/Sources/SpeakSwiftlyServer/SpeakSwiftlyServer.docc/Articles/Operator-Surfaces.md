# Operator Surfaces

## Overview

The package exposes one shared host through three operator-oriented surfaces:

- the embedded Swift library surface in this DocC catalog
- the standalone `SpeakSwiftlyServerTool` executable
- the HTTP and MCP transports that the standalone server can publish

These surfaces share the same underlying host model, but they answer different ownership questions.

## Surface Roles

### Embedded Library

Use ``EmbeddedServerSession`` and ``ServerState`` when an app owns the process and wants direct
state observation on the main actor.

Internally, the embedded path now keeps package-owned lifecycle concerns explicit: one outer
service-owned group coordinates host startup and shutdown, optional config watching, optional MCP
readiness and drain, and the wrapped Hummingbird application. App code should still treat the
session object as the lifecycle boundary and `ServerState` as the UI-facing projection rather than
as the owner of the runtime.

### Command-Line Tool

`SpeakSwiftlyServerTool` is the operator entrypoint for starting the server directly or managing the LaunchAgent property list workflow. The main command types exposed by the package are:

- ``SpeakSwiftlyServerToolCommand``
- ``LaunchAgentCommand``
- ``SpeakSwiftlyServerToolCommandError``
- ``LaunchAgentCommandError``

The companion executable walkthrough starts at <doc:Using-The-Command-Line-Tool>.

### HTTP And MCP

The HTTP and MCP surfaces are transport adapters around the same host state and runtime operations. They are the right choice when another process, a local service manager, or an external client should own the session.

This DocC catalog intentionally stays library-first. For the transport inventory, request and response payloads, and command reference, use the repository docs:

- [README](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/README.md)
- [API Reference](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftlyServer/blob/main/API.md)
