# SpeakSwiftly API Coverage Matrix

## Purpose

This document compares the public `SpeakSwiftly` library surface resolved by this repository's current package dependency against the client-facing surfaces implemented by `SpeakSwiftlyServer`.

It is meant to answer three concrete questions:

1. Which public `SpeakSwiftly` capabilities are already exposed here?
2. Which public capabilities are only partially exposed or intentionally hidden?
3. Which surface is the more appropriate client contract for each capability: HTTP, MCP, both, or neither?

Current baseline checked against the `SpeakSwiftly` version resolved in this repository on `2026-04-05`.

The resolved `SpeakSwiftly` dependency had moved forward with a repackaged public dependency surface, one-shot `textProfileName` speech selection, and a public text-normalization API hanging off the runtime normalizer. That follow-through pass is now landed here:

1. package and import alignment
   `SpeakSwiftlyServer` now depends on `TextForSpeech` directly instead of assuming the sibling package re-exports it
2. runtime-call alignment
   the server bridge now uses the current `speak(..., textProfileName:textContext:sourceFormat:id:)` shape that the current sibling runtime exposes for this flow
3. transport-surface expansion
   `createClone(...)` plus the new text-profile inspection, persistence, and editing helpers now have first-class HTTP and MCP coverage
4. format-aware request support
   HTTP and MCP speech submission now carry `text_format`, `nested_source_format`, and `source_format` through to the runtime instead of dropping explicit normalization intent

## Summary

`SpeakSwiftlyServer` exposes almost the entire public runtime control plane:

- runtime lifecycle and readiness are represented through host startup plus health and status endpoints
- speech submission, profile mutation, queue inspection, playback control, queue clearing, and request cancellation are all exposed
- runtime status and request-event streams are translated into job snapshots, SSE, host snapshots, and MCP resources

What is not exposed one-to-one today:

- the library-only `accept(line:)` request-decoding entrypoint
- the raw library event and status stream types as first-class client contracts
- some library detail enums and payload types in their native shape

That means the server is best understood as a transport-oriented adapter over the public runtime, not as a byte-for-byte network mirror of the Swift library API.

## Intentional Non-Parity

These items should stay server-internal or transport-adapted unless the product goals change:

- `SpeakSwiftly.live()`, `Runtime.start()`, and `Runtime.shutdown()`
  These are host-lifecycle concerns, not client operations.

- `Runtime.accept(line:)`
  This is a line-based transport and request-decoding entrypoint. It is useful inside the library or CLI boundary, but it would be the wrong abstraction for HTTP or MCP clients.

- raw `AsyncThrowingStream` and `AsyncStream` handles
  HTTP and MCP clients are better served by retained jobs, SSE, resources, and polling endpoints than by trying to mimic Swift concurrency primitives on the wire.

## Concrete Gaps

### 1. MCP tool naming still follows worker-op vocabulary

Names such as `queue_speech_live`, `list_queue_generation`, and `playback_state` are perfectly valid, but they still read like protocol operation names. That makes sense historically because they line up with the worker op names, but it is slightly less ergonomic for higher-level clients than a more product-shaped vocabulary.

This is not a correctness issue. It is mainly a polish and ergonomics issue.

### 2. Remaining transport-local model shaping still needs one cleanup pass

The host and transport layers still keep some server-owned snapshot wrappers around runtime summaries, job events, and playback state. Most of that shaping is intentional because HTTP and MCP need stable, localhost-friendly wire contracts, but a final review should still trim any wrappers that no longer buy clarity now that the runtime and text normalizer are both typed and public.

## Surface Appropriateness

## HTTP

HTTP is the best client surface for:

- local apps
- UI processes
- scripting clients
- anything that wants stable request and response payloads

Why it works well:

- submission uses a clean `202 Accepted` job model
- long-running work is retained and inspectable
- SSE provides a reasonable transport for live updates
- health, readiness, queue, playback, and status concepts are easy for non-Swift clients to consume

Main weaknesses:

- explicitly localhost and trust-boundary-local, not a general remote API
- no explicit API versioning yet

## MCP

MCP is the best client surface for:

- agent tooling
- operator workflows
- prompt-driven or assistant-driven control flows
- consumers that benefit from resource subscriptions and prompt catalog support

Why it works well:

- tools map naturally to command-style operations
- resources provide a read model without forcing clients to orchestrate polling manually
- subscriptions make runtime updates convenient for agent hosts
- prompts are a good fit for reusable voice-design and acknowledgement authoring

Main weaknesses:

- tool names still skew low-level and protocol-shaped
- some data is easier to discover through resource conventions than through tool-return schemas alone

## Recommended Next Moves

The highest-value library-alignment follow-through items from the previous review are now landed:

1. `POST /speak` and `queue_speech_live` both accept normalization context through `cwd`, `repo_root`, `text_format`, and `nested_source_format`, plus one-shot stored-profile selection through `text_profile_name` and explicit whole-source normalization through `source_format`.
2. HTTP now exposes `GET /jobs`.
3. Accepted-job MCP results now include `job_resource_uri`.
4. Voice clone creation now has matching HTTP and MCP job flows.
5. Text-profile inspection, persistence, and replacement editing now have matching HTTP routes, MCP tools, and MCP resources.

At this point, the remaining differences are mostly intentional transport adaptations rather than missing runtime capabilities.

## Next Follow-Through Slice

The next library-alignment pass should stay inside this repository and focus on cleanup and operator clarity rather than new feature reach:

1. decide whether any remaining low-level MCP tool names should be promoted to more product-shaped names
2. tighten the README and maintainer docs whenever the resolved runtime dependency surface shifts again
3. remove any server-local transport translation that is still redundant now that both `SpeakSwiftly` and `TextForSpeech` are wired through directly
